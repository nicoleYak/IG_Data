IG_DATA - SQL DATA ANALYST PROJECT

Analyzing Instagram-like data to ask and answer questions regarding user activity and engagement, user retention and growth, and content performance.

Here are some of the questions I've asked before analyzing the data in SQL:

User activity & engagement -

1 - Who is the most active user on Instagram? based on their engagement and activity on the app.

2- Which post has the highest engagement and is the most popular, based on the likes and comments?

User retention and growth -

3 - How has the user base grown over time? Analyzing the trend in user sign ups over different periods of time (daily, weekly, monthly).

4 - What is the user retention rate? (Based on posting photos). Using Cohort Analysis, calculating the percentage of users who are still active after a certain period of time (1 month, 3 months).

5 - Which hashtags are the most effective for driving engagement? I need a list of hashtags ordered by the total engagement they generated.

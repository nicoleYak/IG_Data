# IG_Data - Data Analyst Project
Analyzing Instagram-like data to ask and answer questions regarding user activity and engagement, 
user retention and growth, and content performance.


Data Manipulation Steps:

1. Created a database and set up the schema.
2. Inserted all the data into the tables.
3. Asked some basic questions to help me better understand the data Iâ€™m working with.

The questions:

* Who are the oldest users on Instagram?
* What day of the week do most users register on?
* Who are the users who have never posted?
* How many times does the average user post?
* What are the top 5 most commonly used #hashtags?
* Who are the users that are most likely a bot?
* Who is the most active user? Using multiple approaches.
* What is the most popular photo with the highest engagement?
* What is the trend in user sign ups over different periods of time?
* What is the user retention rate? (1 month & 3 months after signing up).
* Who are the users with the highest number of followers?
* Which hashtags are most effective for driving engagement?
